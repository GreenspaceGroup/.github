## The DISCIPLINE Of Optimizing Local Public Greenspaces

It will require effort, dedication and discipline ... more than you can imagine ... it will not just fall together.

If it were going to happen by itself, it already would have happened ... it will be up to YOU to help:

* Develop a network of people who enjoy hiking, wildcrafting, gardening, ethnobotany and related topics
* Share tools/resources for landscape architecture, native plants herbalism, species conservation, low impact camping 
* Form an operational entity to buy/preserve/optimize local naturual heritage sites as sculpted preserves

## The NEW Logic of Collective Action

It's not about rent-seeking behavior on the part of politicians and salaried organizational staff as the OLD logic of collection action was. The NEW logic of collective action demands that constituent developers understand that achieving objectives will require their own personal effort, dedication, discipline and money ... the NEW logic of collective action also requires that constituent developers will get more out of the sharing activity than what they put in because they will meet others who are similarly committed to putting in the effort, deiciation, discipline and money for something that all of the constituent developers value. The network is the reward as well as the engine for accomplishing the collective action ... constituent developers either *get* this or they don't. 

This NEW logic is that simple ... because it always had been that simple ... but understand: SIMPLE, in any group activity involving creative, passionate human beings, is never going to be easy.
